### Key Benefits

- **Seamless Transition**: Automatically convert your `README.md` into a full-fledged website without manual intervention.
- **Effortless Publishing**: Streamline the workflow, reducing manual steps and potential errors.
- **Leverage Themes and Plugins**: Enhance your siteâ€™s appearance and functionality with Jekyll themes and plugins.
- **Enhanced Content Management**: Include additional content beyond your `README.md`, such as blogs, documentation, and tutorials.
- **SEO and Discoverability**: Optimize your site for search engines.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Easily expand and integrate with other platforms.
- **Integration with Other Platforms**: Effortlessly publish to other platforms or websites.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of Git and Markdown
- Ruby and Bundler installed on your local machine (for local testing)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Repository

Create a new GitHub repository named `gh-pages` or clone this repo.

### 2. Create a script to prepare for Jekyll build

Create a script `.github/scripts/init-jekyll.sh` to convert `README.md` to `index.md`, which allows Jekyll to process it and generate `index.html`. During this conversion, you can embellish the `index.md` with additional information, such as metadata, navigation links, and other content enhancements, to improve the blogging experience.

<button onclick="fetchAndDisplayScript('script-content-init-jekyll', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kingting/gh-pages/main/.github/scripts/init-jekyll.sh')">Show init-jekyll.sh</button>
<div id="script-content-init-jekyll" style="display:none; white-space: pre-wrap;"></div>

### 3. Configure GitHub Actions Workflows to build Jekyll site and deploy to GitHub Pages

Create a GitHub Actions workflow at .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml that includes build and deployment jobs for GitHub Pages.

<button onclick="fetchAndDisplayScript('script-content-gh-pages', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kingting/gh-pages/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml')">Show gh-pages.yml</button>
<div id="script-content-gh-pages" style="display:none; white-space: pre-wrap;"></div>

### 4. Test Locally

To test the site locally with the `baseurl` set:

Build the site:
```sh
./.github/scripts/init-jekyll.sh
bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl="/gh-pages"
```

Serve the site:
```sh
cd _site
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl="/gh-pages"
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000/gh-pages/` to verify.

### 5. Commit Changes to README.md, and GitHub Pages Will Be Automatically Updated

Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Set up Jekyll site with GitHub Actions"
git push origin main
```

Go to your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to "Pages" under "Code and automation," and ensure the Source under "GitHub Pages" - "Build and Deployment" is set to "GitHub Actions."

Your site should now be live at `https://username.github.io/gh-pages`.

## Additional Customizations

Feel free to customize your Jekyll site by editing the `_config.yml`, adding new pages, and modifying the styles in `assets/css/style.scss`.

To add custom styles, create `assets/css/style.scss` with the following content:

```scss
---
---

@import "jekyll-theme-cayman";

// Your custom styles go here
body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```
